# Iris Species Prediction using ML
The Iris Species Prediction Project is an end-to-end machine learning application that classifies iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project involves data collection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

•	Developed a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris species.   
•	A detailed EDA report is generated using ydata_profiling, providing insights into missing values, feature distributions, and correlations.   
•	The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. A Random Forest Classifier is chosen due to its ability to handle classification tasks effectively. It performs well on structured datasets like Iris and does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning. The model is evaluated using the following metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score   
•	To ensure reproducibility and performance tracking, MLFlow is integrated into the project.       
•	The trained model is deployed as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with it.   
•	Containerized the application using Docker for easy deployment.
